lead_text: "In my senior year of high school, I developed a web app to analyze how positively or negatively different news sources reported on different topics. After the user enters keywords and selects two news sources (eg. CNN, Fox News, etc.), the app processes recent articles using the Natural Language Toolkit library to evaluate sentiment. Finally, it uses Plotly to visualize the different sources' sentiment against each other, making it easy to see how each source portrays the chosen topics."

lead_text: "This is a game I made in Processing when I was in high school. I just thought it would be fun to put it on here. Click on the game panel, then type a number between 0-8 to choose a level (0 will play all of the levels). See if you can beat it! :)\n
Controls: WASD for movement, press or hold space to shoot, hold j to limit movement for precise dodging, press p to pause."

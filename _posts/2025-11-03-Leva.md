lead_text: "Leva is a B2B software startup designed to empower women in the workplace through mentorship. I co-founded and individually developed the minimum viable product for Leva during my freshman year of college,
and later recruited two team members to help with front-end development. 
Leva essentially allows employees to sign up as mentors or mentees, then suggests pairings based on 
common interests, career interests, and shared educational history. Mentees can have more than one mentor, and mentors can have more than one mentee. We work with a company representative to create an agenda for different topics of discussion for weekly meetings, so that after they approve the matches, our users can have valuable meetings.
I directed the development of the website's second iteration for a >50 user beta test with Northwestern's Society of Women Engineers and achieved 0 reported bugs despite heavy use."

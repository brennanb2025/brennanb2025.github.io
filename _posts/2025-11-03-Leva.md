lead_text: "Leva is a B2B software startup designed to empower women in the workplace through mentorship. I co-founded and individually developed the minimum viable product for Leva during my freshman year of college,
and later recruited two team members to help with front-end development. I also directed the development of the website's second iteration (and did almost all of the backend development) for a >50 user beta test with Northwestern's Society of Women Engineers, achieving 0 reported bugs despite heavy use. Please give the demo video a watch!"

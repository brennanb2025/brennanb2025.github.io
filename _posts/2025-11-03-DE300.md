As my final project for a Data Engineering 300 course, I created a Spark DAG pipeline, hosted in AWS MWAA using Apache Airflow, to:\n
1. Read the configuration file from S3\n
2. Use Pandas to load heart disease .csv file and Scrapy to scrape data from web to impute missing values in 'smoke' column based on age\n
3. Add data to RDS SQL database for further imputation/engineering\n
4. Impute data to remove outliers\n
5. Use Spark and Pandas to perform feature engineering on specific columns\n
6. Train Spark and SKLearn SVC/logistic regression models with data\n
7. Evaluate each model's performance and choose the best model"

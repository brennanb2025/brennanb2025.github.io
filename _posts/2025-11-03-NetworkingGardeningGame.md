lead_text: "In order to help me manage and visualize my professional network, I created a gardening game where connections are represented as plants that grow with regular outreach. The game lets you store details about each connection, schedule future outreach dates, and set recurring intervals for follow-ups. Each time you reach out, you can log notes about the interaction and 'water' the plant to reset its outreach timer. It also includes the option to set special outreach reminders, such as congratulating a contact on a new product launch. I developed a Java Spring Boot REST API for the backend, fully tested, and am now working on a React frontend (this was mostly a backend/testing exercise - the picture to the left is just a sample frontend)."
